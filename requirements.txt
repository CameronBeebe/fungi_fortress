# This project relies on the standard Python 'curses' library.
#
# On Linux and macOS, 'curses' is typically included with the Python installation
# or managed by the system's package manager (e.g., ncurses).
# Ensure you have the necessary development headers if compiling Python from source
# (e.g., libncursesw5-dev on Debian/Ubuntu).
#
# On Windows, the 'curses' module is not included. You need to install 'windows-curses'.
# The following line uses environment markers to install it only on Windows:

windows-curses; sys_platform == "win32"
noise # For procedural map generation

# Add other Python package dependencies here if needed in the future, e.g.:
# numpy >= 1.20
# some-other-package == 1.2.3

# Development Dependencies
pytest>=7.0 # For running tests
mypy>=1.0   # For static type checking
